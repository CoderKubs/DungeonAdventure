# DungeonAdventure


A summary of my ultimate aspiration for the project:
I wanted this project to be fun to make and to play. I had to think about how I wanted the combat
to run, and I found this! I made an inventory system in addition. One of my favorite things to add
to my projects is many easter eggs. Keep looking! I wanted a storyline, but I found that it would
take MUCH longer for me to add enough levels to include a story. The story I have is simple, yet 
it is enough.

Why this project was interesting:
I had so much fun figuring out how to do each little part. Figuring out how to make the enemys see
and chase the player was probably my favorite part! Another fun part was asking my friends to playtest
it to see what I could improve on. As it turns out, they found many gamebreaking bugs, which I quickly fixed.

What I managed to do: 
I managed to make a maze, with different rooms and sections.
I made an inventory system, enemy AI, a loot pool, a simple storyline, a combat system, and (my favorite) a boss fight!

What I learned:
After a little bit of time, I quickly learned that I needed to organize my code better. I decided to group the methods
by how related they are, and by how recently I added them. 
I also learned how to create my own variable type to simplify the process of creating a character and enemys.
In addition, I learned how to recognize when I am repeating code too often. I simply have to make a method out of it to save space and time.
